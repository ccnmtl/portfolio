CTL Portfolio

The Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) at Columbia University leverages its extensive experience with the purposeful use of media and technology to support teaching and learning projects and services. Working collaboratively with instructors, the CTL staff engages in a range of projects requiring software development, interface and experience design, media production, and project management, while maintaining a service-oriented disposition.

CTL learning designers, programmers, designers, media producers, and project managers collaborate with faculty to create reusable and scalable software and applications that serve Columbia students, and in some cases, the public at-large.
